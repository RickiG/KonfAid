KonfAid
=======

Project for UIKode Hackday 2013. Uses the tesseract engine to look for emails, websites and twitter handles in a picture.
By no means perfect or even complete.

------------------------------------
Running KonfAid
====================================
The Tesseract repo used is added with CocoaPods.
For the project to run and to ensure you have the latest version of the Tesseract repo, make sure you run:

```bash
pod install
```

And open the project workspace KonfAid.xcworkspace, ***not*** KonfAid.xcodeproj.
